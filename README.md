# Sulam-Project
Budi@larm is a flood-alert mobile application developed under the SULAM initiative to support the community of Kampung Budiman. It connects with a Smart Flood Beacon device to provide real-time water level monitoring, alert notifications, emergency contact access, and navigation to nearby temporary shelters (PPS).

This project integrates IoT hardware, mobile app development, and community engagement to improve flood preparedness and public safety.
